# QMST 5367 Machine Learning - Plant Image Processing

## TEAM 5 GROUP MEMBERS:

##### Introduce a hypothetical business scenario. 
###### We are a startup company that is developing an app where users take pictures of plants and the app will identify the plants using machine learning. We have premium and free services, where the premium service includes expanded plant image recognition. Some of our target customers would be Boy Scout or Girl Scout groups, avid hikers, forest rangers and other personnel that work in parks, forests, and other national settings, and even hobbyist foragers who want to improve their leisure activity experience. For this project, we will focus on the free service where plant recognition will be limited to specific types of plants. This focus will help us test the waters as far as demand so we can more accurately target development for premium services.

##### Describe a way in which a machine learning system can enhance or replace certain business functions. 
###### We will train the machine learning algorithm with datasets of plant images to identify species of plants after taking a photo. This removes the effort and time to research plant information and type online. The app will use supervised machine learning since in the end the user knows the plant type, and the algorithm will choose the best match using statistical significance. The beauty of this app is that as more users contribute images from the wild to our dataset, the more accurate the model can become.

##### Describe the data you may use as input to your machine learning model. 
###### We will be using a dataset that includes images of plants classified into groups. In total, there are three categories where each category has between 150-300 images. We may gather more photos to train the machine learning algorithm.

##### List/describe the data sources you may obtain/use for your project. 
###### We will use datasets of images collected by software engineers and related experts in the field of plant image recognition. The data sources are not limited to but may include: https://www.kaggle.com/emmarex/plantdisease and https://github.com/bazilione/poison_ivy/blob/master/data_all.zip.
